<h2>cs106a Programming Methodology</h2>
<p>This repo fits the 2007 version of the course cs106a, which include all the labs/assignments. I tried my best 
to make the uploaded code bug-free and also satisfy the original specs. </p>
<p>CS106A is the largest of the introductory programming courses and is one of the largest courses at Stanford. Topics
focus on the introduction to the engineering of computer applications emphasizing modern software engineering 
principles: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. Programming Methodology 
teaches the widely-used Java programming language along with good software engineering principles. Emphasis is on good
programming style and the built-in facilities of the Java language. The course is explicitly designed to appeal to
humanists and social scientists as well as hard-core techies. In fact, most Programming Methodology graduates end up
majoring outside of the School of Engineering.</p>
